Human Face Recognition Using CNN and HOG Face Detector

In this project, I developed an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize human faces. The process involved several key steps:

Face Detection: I utilized the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) face detector to identify human faces in images.
Data Preparation: After detecting faces, I collected and labeled data for 10 different individuals.
Model Training: I created a Sequential model and trained it on the labeled data of these 10 individuals.
Model Testing: The trained model was then tested on a separate test dataset containing previously unseen images of the same 10 individuals. The model leveraged its training to accurately identify the individuals in the test images.
