# face-detector-using-CNN
In this Project I have used CNN model for Image Classification where I first used Hog Face detector to detect human faces, after detecting the human faces of 10 different persons I created a Sequential model training on the labelled data of 10 different persons.
After training on the labelled data the model is tested against the tet_data containing never seen images of the same 10 persons and Using the learnings on the training data, the model works on identifying the persons in the process.
